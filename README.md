## Continuous Deployment using AWS Code Pipeline and S3 ⚙️☁️
The game leverages AWS services for seamless deployment and hosting. Here’s how it works:

1. **S3 Bucket Hosting:**
    - Create an S3 bucket to host the game as a static website.
    - Set proper permissions to allow public access to the game files.

2. **AWS CodePipeline:**
    - Automate your deployment process.
    - The pipeline pulls code from your GitHub repository and deploys it to the S3 bucket whenever changes are      detected.

3. **End-to-End Workflow:**
    - Modify your code on GitHub → The pipeline detects the change → Updates are deployed to S3 automatically.

## The Deployment Environment 🚀
- **Hosting:** The game is deployed and hosted on an S3 bucket for scalability and speed.
- **Automation:** Continuous deployment is set up using AWS CodePipeline for efficient updates.

## The Deployment Pipeline 🚀
The pipeline is created using AWS Code Pipeline.  The pipeline pulls the code from GitHub, and deploys it to S3 whenever a change is detected in the code.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
